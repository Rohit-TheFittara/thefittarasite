Before You Build Anything, Get Clarity
The Fittara Launch Compass

Most founders lose money not because they worked less --
but because they built the wrong thing first.

Websites. Ads. Agencies. Tools.
All paid for before knowing if they make sense.

Fittara Launch Compass exists to stop that.

What Is the Launch Compass?

The Launch Compass is a paid, independent evaluation that tells you:

- Whether you should even build a website right now
- Which channel actually makes sense for your brand
- What to avoid spending money on -- including Fittara itself

This is not onboarding.
This is not consulting fluff.
This is a decision filter.

Who This Is For

This evaluation is for you if:

- You're planning to launch or grow a fashion / apparel D2C brand
- You're unsure whether to start with:
  - a website
  - marketplaces
  - Instagram / WhatsApp
- You don't want to burn money learning the hard way
- You want truth over motivation

If you're only looking for someone to say "yes, build a website", this is not for you.

What We Evaluate (In Detail)

You'll answer a structured questionnaire (15-20 minutes).
We evaluate your brand across four non-negotiable dimensions:

1. Product Reality
   - Price points (AOV)
   - SKU repeatability
   - Return & exchange risk
   - Visual storytelling strength
   - Repeat purchase potential

2. Founder Reality
   - Available budget
   - Time commitment
   - Operational readiness
   - Comfort with selling & customer interaction

3. Channel Readiness
   - Marketplace viability
   - Instagram traction
   - Website readiness
   - Paid ads maturity

4. Unit Economics Sanity
   - Gross margins
   - Shipping & RTO tolerance
   - Ability to survive early experiments

No theory. No vanity metrics.
Only things that actually decide success.

What You Get After the Evaluation

1. A Clear Verdict (No Ambiguity)

You will receive a direct recommendation such as:

- Do NOT build a website yet
- Start with Instagram + WhatsApp intelligence
- Marketplaces only for now
- You are ready to scale with a full website

We don't soften this to sell you something.

2. A Detailed Readiness Score

You'll get a scored breakdown showing:

- Where you are strong
- Where you are exposed
- What is holding you back right now

This becomes your baseline, not just advice.

3. Channel-by-Channel Recommendation

Instead of "everything everywhere", you'll know:

- What to start with
- What to delay
- What to completely avoid for now

Including whether you should use:

- AI creatives
- Catalog intelligence
- Instagram auto-posting & engagement analysis
- WhatsApp marketing & conversation insights
- A full website (or not)

4. A 90-Day Action Roadmap

You'll receive a simple, practical plan:

- What to focus on in Month 1
- What to test in Month 2
- When to re-evaluate bigger investments

No dependency on agencies.
No forced tooling.

Important: This Is NOT a Sales Pitch

This evaluation is intentionally behind a paywall for one reason:

If the evaluation is free, it becomes marketing.
If it's paid, it becomes truth.

We are comfortable telling you:

- "Don't build a website yet"
- "Don't run ads yet"
- "Don't use Fittara yet"

That honesty is the product.

Pricing & Fairness

- One-time evaluation fee
- No auto-upgrades
- No obligation to continue

If the evaluation recommends a Fittara website later,
the fee is adjusted into your onboarding.

If it doesn't -- you still walk away with clarity.

Why We Built This

Because most founders don't fail from lack of effort.

They fail from:

- Starting with the wrong channel
- Spending too early
- Listening to people who always say "yes"

The Launch Compass exists to be the voice that says:

"Pause. Let's think first."

Ready to Start?

If you want clarity before valuation, tech, ads, or agencies:

Begin with the Fittara Launch Compass.

Don't spend on tools yet -- even ours.
Spend on knowing what actually makes sense.
